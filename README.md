url-mover
=========

A chrome extension to redirect URLs based on a set of rules. Essentially it rewrites the URLs as the requests are being made, so you can test websites. The original use case was to test local changes to a common javascript library used accross a set of public websites. 

A more comprehensive tool to do this is the [Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) proxy. For serious work I would recommend that tool over this one, all though the approach is obviously completely different. 


If you want to use this simple tool, check out the [Chrome Plugin Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-mover/opdaflkhdoimciegepglnoekjpbfkpgg).
